## Task 1: How important are GRE scores?
   Task details: GRE scores are obviously important, but how important? 
   Is there a certain point where spending tens of hours to improve a few points not worth it?
   Use machine learning techniques to plot a curve: GRE score vs. chance of admission. Post the RMSE for the machine learning model used.

## Task 2: Predict Likelihood of Admission
   Task details: Using the supplied predictive variables (GRE score, TOEFL score, University Rating, etc) to predict the likelihood of admission of a new candidate.)
